loading broadPeak and narrowPeak datasets onto the UCSC Genome Browser. 
The problem that you are having is that the UCSC Genome Browser is not sure how to read the files that you are providing. 
Based on the initial structure, it assumes that they are BED files (http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1). 
The later fields of a standard BED file, however, do not match the data in your files. 
Specifically, the first line is

chr6	47650976	47651432	.	1000	.	190.60379	-1.00000	2.19590	228

and the value in the seventh column. The browser attempts to interpret that number as the thickStart coordinate and can't figure it out.
The way to get around this issue is to explicitly tell the browser what type of data is stored in each of these files. 
You can do this by unzipping the file and using a text editor to add a "track line" to the top of the file. 
For example, you could add a line so that the first two lines read:

track type=narrowPeak name="Day1_narrowPeak" 
chr6	47650976	47651432	.	1000	.	190.60379	-1.00000	2.19590	228

You should then be able to submit your files as custom tracks.
